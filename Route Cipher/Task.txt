Decryption
To decrypt a message receivedthat has been encoded with
the Route Cipher, we need to know the route 
used and the width or height of the grid. We then start by
constructing a blank grid of the right size, and then place the 
ciphertext letters in the grid following the route specified.For example, 
to decrypt the ciphertext "TIEIXTXXEAHSIHSPNTLT" with the route spiral 
inwards counterclockwisefrom the top right, with a grid width of 4, we follow
the process shown aboveto obtain the text THISISTHEPLAINTEXT.

Encryption
First we write the plaintext in a block of reasonable size for
the plaintext. Part of your key is the size of this grid, 
so you need to decide on either a number of columns or number 
of rows in the grid before starting. Once thecharacters of theplaintext 
are written out sequentially out in the grid, you use the Route assigned. 
This could be spiraling inwards starting from the top leftcorner in a 
counterclockwise directionin case the key is positive, or spiraling inwards
starting from the bottom right corner in a counterclockwisedirectionin 
case the key is negative.Thus, the key absolute value determines the number
of the columns in the grid, while the sign of the key determines the 
orientation of the route for encryption and decryption.As an example, 
lets encrypt the plaintext "ABORT THE MISSION, YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED".
Assume the key is a signed integer value, whose absolute value defines 
the number of the columns. For clarity, let’s say -5. The absolute value 
of the key determines that cipher will use a grid with 5 columns. 
The above figure shows how the sample plaintext is written in a grid 
of five columns, where the number of the rows depends on the length of the plaintext.
